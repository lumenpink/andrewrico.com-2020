### What We Do
We provide the tools so that you can search, compare, find and apply for health insurance products. Think of us as an engine of information.

If you find a plan on our site and decide to submit an application, we send your completed application to the entity processing your membership, which may be the carrier or its administrator. Be sure to read the privacy and terms of use policy for the entity processing your policy membership.

We are not an insurance carrier, so we don’t underwrite your insurance and we don’t process or manage insurance claims. The insurance carrier handles those services.

### We Know Health Insurance
We believe that health insurance is not a one size fits all market. Life is full of unexpected changes and transitions. You may need insurance to cover a short-term gap, help you through a period of unemployment, or have found that Obamacare is unavailable, out of reach, or not the right solution for you. Short Term Health Insurance and Health Benefit Indemnity insurance ("HBI") serve as a flexible and affordable options. Short Term Health Insurance is major medical insurance that will protect you in case of accident or illness. With Short Term health insurance, you will be covered for medical services including hospital stays, doctors and specialist visits, x-rays, and many other procedures.

HBI insurance is an indemnity product that offers financial protection for commonly needed medical services, including hospital and doctor services. When you experience a covered medical event, HBI pays a set fee, directly to you or a provider designated by you.

You can apply for either type of insurance at any time and you can choose your doctor. That’s why we are proud to offer you these options.

Short Term Health Insurance and HBI are not Obamacare. They are not required to comply with certain federal market requirements for health insurance, principally those contained in the Affordable Care Act. Be sure to check your policy carefully to make sure you are aware of any exclusions or limitations regarding coverage of preexisting conditions or health benefits (such as hospitalization, emergency services, maternity care, preventive care, prescription drugs, and mental health and substance use disorder services). 
Your policy might also have lifetime and/or annual dollar limits on health benefits. If this coverage expires or you lose eligibility for this coverage, you might have to wait until an open enrollment period to get other health insurance coverage.
Also, this coverage is not "minimum essential coverage." If you don’t have minimum essential coverage for any month in 2018, you may have to make a payment when you file your tax return unless you qualify for an exemption from the requirement that you have health coverage for that month.

### Dental, Vision and Supplemental Products
We offer Dental and Vision insurance through well-respected carriers. Our dental and vision plans do not require underwriting, which means you are guaranteed approval. Our telemedicine products give your 24x7 access to doctors—you can consult with a doctor via telephone or video chat at your convenience.
We also offer supplemental insurance and services In the event of an accident or critical illnesses, supplemental indemnity insurance will make a cash payment to you.
Supplemental insurance products are not designed to replace your major medical insurance. 
In addition, we offer supplemental services such as telemedicine, which provides you access to a doctor 24x7 for advice on common medical needs. 
Telemedicine is not intended to replace your primary physician’s care.
When considering health insurance, know your health and what you need. If you’re concerned that your major medical does not provide adequate coverage for critical illness, or if you need dental care, then our supplemental insurance and services can fill in those gaps.

### Existing Insurance Coverage
If you’ve found a health insurance plan through us, we are thrilled that we were able to help. However, be Insurance Wise.
DO NOT CANCEL ANY EXISTING INSURANCE UNTIL YOU RECEIVE WRITTEN CONFIRMATION FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY TO WHICH YOU ARE APPLYING THAT YOUR NEW POLICY IS IN EFFECT.
